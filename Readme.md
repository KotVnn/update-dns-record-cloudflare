# Auto update DNS record to Cloudflare
### A small app for update your external IP to cloudflare

1. You need change name ```example.config.json``` to ```config.json```
2. Execute your Cloudflare API, domain and record to ```config.json```
3. You can start app instance or via docker container. (But I config Dockerfile for use only in my server, let make it by yourself :P )
